## CURRENT

### PHASE-C-002 — Popup-hosted + standalone composite focus/interaction migration
Status: READY
Task progress: 0%

Why this is current:
- PHASE-C-001 FocusController foundation is merged and green through PR #52 and main #334.
- The handbook Phase C order next targets Select / TreeSelect / Cascader / Menu / Tags.
- A targeted read-only audit is already complete; do not repeat a full focus audit.

Frozen impact map:
- Select / TreeSelect / Cascader are editable real-focus hosts with popup-hosted virtual domains. Their existing OptionList/Tree/Cascader list selection owners remain unchanged.
- Menu / Tags are standalone composite roots that still create KeyboardRegion directly and need explicit FocusController profiles/ownership.
- TagNavigation is already the canonical tag virtual-navigation helper and remains the tag-domain behavior owner; do not duplicate it inside FocusController.
- Existing browser smoke already covers Select Enter/Home/End, TreeSelect Enter/Space, Cascader Enter, Menu cross-level arrows/disclosure, Tags visible focus/add-editor/duplicate-input flows. Add only ownership/profile/lease/hosted-domain regressions that are missing.

Scope:
- migrate Select / TreeSelect / Cascader real host + hosted virtual-domain orchestration into FocusController without changing ValueController, Selection, SearchState, Tree or popup-open ownership;
- migrate Menu / Tags KeyboardRegion entry points into FocusController and author explicit ComponentProfile focus/interaction metadata;
- preserve editable text priority, IME guards, Home/End behavior and context-specific Enter/Space semantics;
- for Tags edit mode, use FocusController edit lease semantics rather than introducing another focus flag;
- eliminate direct component imports of KeyboardRegion where FocusController can replace the entry point;
- do not start InteractionController/CapabilityController as separate engines unless a concrete duplicated authority must be replaced in this pack.

Next exact step:
1. create a fresh PHASE-C-002 branch from current main after this checkpoint;
2. migrate Select / TreeSelect / Cascader outer keyboard hosts first, using FocusController while keeping existing hosted domains;
3. migrate Menu / Tags standalone roots and Tags edit lease;
4. add structural ownership gates plus only the missing browser regressions;
5. run full PR release CI, merge only green, then verify main CI + Pages.

## Current authority snapshot — after Phase A

This section is current-state truth. Do not treat earlier Phase A gap findings as still active if they conflict with this snapshot.

- Action/event metadata: `ActionContext` and structured `OperationResult` exist above existing `InteractionDetails`, `OpenStateBridge` and logical events.
- Value ownership: `ValueController` is the canonical committed/draft/preview/rawInput/session/revision authority. `ValueDraft` is a compatibility alias and `StateController.create()` delegates to it; `ControllableStateCore` still owns controlled/external-vs-internal and pending-request metadata. DatePicker / TimePicker / ColorPicker / WheelPicker declare ValueController ownership directly. There is no second committed value.
- Logical ownership: `LogicalOwnership` remains node/parent-child authority; `LogicalOwnerTree` exists as the shared facade/registry layer.
- Focus/navigation: `FocusController` is the aggregate entry point over `FocusManager`, `FocusScope`, `KeyboardRegion` and `KeyboardNavigation` virtual focus. WheelPanel / TimePanel / Calendar / PeriodPanel enter through it; underlying ActiveItem/RovingProjection/domain state remains the execution truth. PHASE-C-002 migrates the remaining first-wave popup/standalone composites without adding a second focus truth.
- Overlay/open: `OpenStateBridge`, `OverlayRuntime`, `LayerManager`, `DismissableLayer` and `PopupSurface` remain the existing authorities. OverlayController must not become a second public open-state owner.
- Form: `FormBridge` remains native field/FormData/reset carrier authority.
- Theme/token: `Config` remains root/scoped theme and token projection authority; Theme/Token Controller adoption is pending.
- Selection/data: `Selection`, `HierarchicalSelection`, `Collection`, `ActiveItem` and `TableModel` remain selection/collection authorities. `Collection` now uses shared `DataRevision` for stale-transaction revision ownership.
- Projection/scheduling: shared `ProjectionScheduler` exists over `Scheduler`, but it is intentionally not inserted into synchronous `DOMProjection` / `RovingProjection` paths until it can replace a real stale/async projection owner.
- Motion: `MotionCore`, `Transition` and `TransitionGroup` remain the low-level motion authority; no parallel generation counter may be introduced.
- Environment: `ObserverHub` now delegates Resize/Mutation/Intersection/media environment resolution to shared `EnvironmentPort`; additional ad-hoc environment consumers migrate only when their owning Controller/family is touched.
- Diagnostics: semantic `Diagnostics` with stable codes is injectable; `Collection` reports duplicate stable keys observationally when a sink is supplied. Further diagnostics adoption occurs with the owning Controller.
- Component capability declaration: `Component` and `ComponentRuntime` now carry validated immutable `ComponentProfile` metadata; concrete profiles are authored as each family migrates, with no runtime component-name inference.
- Input modality: existing `InteractionModality` remains the authority and now exposes touch/programmatic modalities plus the `InputModality` alias.
- Shared Protocol verification: `verify:shared-protocol` covers the foundation plus Collection/ValueDraft/StateController integration.

## ACTIVE KNOWN ISSUES — NOT DONE

These are current QA targets for later Controller/family migration. They are not PHASE-A-003 scope unless an authority adoption directly touches them.

- DatePicker dual-panel/month-year navigation can retain stale cursor state and jump on the first arrow after returning to the date region.
- DatePicker/TimePicker preset selection must respect `needConfirm`; preset regions need one Tab stop plus virtual arrow navigation.
- Collapse rapid open/close reversal still needs autosize Motion-level verification/fix rather than a component-local timer patch.

## DONE / VERIFIED EXISTING

### PHASE-C-001 — FocusController foundation + Time/Date composite regions
Status: DONE
Evidence:
- PR #52 merged
- merge commit `a1f19b25ceb2de4ef238e5bbc7d3c4c250c366b0`
- PR CI #333 / `35960898199`: success on attempt 2
- main CI + Pages #334 / `35961330135`: success
- #333 attempt 1 failed only the unrelated high-risk NoticeClock explicit-realm timing check; identical HEAD passed on retry, so runtime was not changed.
Outcome:
- added FocusController as facade over existing focus authorities with no second DOM-focus/domain engine.
- TimePanel root is the sole real-focus/Tab owner; inner WheelPanel is hosted/non-tabbable and the active wheel item owns the visible ring.
- Calendar / PeriodPanel / WheelPanel use the FocusController entry path and canonical virtual-domain binding.
- DatePicker-hosted Calendar keeps real focus on the editor with one virtual cell ring.
- canonical root outline duplication was removed.
- frozen HOTFIX6 artifact remains unchanged; a Phase-C derived compatibility smoke differs in exactly the two superseded TimePanel focus-owner checks, enforced by release-preflight.


### PHASE-B-002 — ValueController + picker-like popup second migration pack
Status: DONE
Evidence:
- PR #51 merged
- merge commit `7f3a475565fec5548871e7c6c52a7ed8c0e945bc`
- PR CI #326 / `35958353342`: success
- main CI + Pages #327 / `35958853046`: success
Outcome:
- `ValueController.createValueBinding()` and `createOptionValueBinding()` are canonical; StateController is compatibility forwarding for these helpers.
- Select / TreeSelect / Cascader use ValueController directly for controlled/defaultValue binding.
- Autocomplete uses ValueController directly for committed/draft value.
- all four declare explicit ValueController ComponentProfile ownership while retaining existing Search/Selection/Tree/OptionList focus authorities.
- structural and browser gates preserve controlled proposal/external-sync and uncontrolled defaultValue semantics.


### PHASE-B-001 — ValueController + Picker Family first migration pack
Status: DONE
Evidence:
- PR #50 merged
- merge commit `be2263e5c9cd388efe42142cfa28657fe0c8f5b4`
- PR CI #324 / `35957442947`: success
- main CI + Pages #325 / `35957755294`: success
- CI #322 initially failed only because TimePicker/WheelPicker duplicated the same scoped Enter-confirm block; the implementation was centralized in `PickerComponent.confirmFromKeyboard()`, then Completion audit and full release passed.
Outcome:
- canonical `ValueController` owns committed/draft/preview/rawInput/session/revision channels; `ValueDraft` is its compatibility alias.
- `PickerSession.close()` no longer performs hidden dirty commit; uncommitted draft rolls back by default.
- DatePicker / TimePicker / ColorPicker / WheelPicker create ValueController directly and declare ComponentProfile ownership.
- Date/Time raw input and hover preview are controller channels; ColorPicker hot-path interaction is preview-first and promotes to draft on completion.
- scoped Enter confirmation is shared by PickerComponent and used by TimePicker / ColorPicker / WheelPicker only in their open confirm session.
- browser coverage verifies draft projection without FormData commit, Esc rollback, immediate preset commit, and scoped Enter confirm.

### PHASE-A-003 — EnvironmentPort / Diagnostics / ComponentProfile authority adoption
Status: DONE
Evidence:
- PR #49 merged
- merge commit `b2ecdb4e33bea642932092693d0ad5a8a47fd4e3`
- PR CI #320 / `35955216461`: success
- main CI + Pages #321 / `35955524890`: success
- PR CI #317 initially failed only the existing platform fail-closed source contract; implementation was corrected so observer constructors remain in the resolved document/window realm and `ObserverHub` retains an explicit fail-closed guard.
Outcome:
- `ObserverHub` delegates observer/media environment resolution to `EnvironmentPort` while retaining scheduling/statistics ownership.
- `EnvironmentPort` covers validated IntersectionObserver construction and no longer leaks observer constructors across resolved realms.
- `Diagnostics` is injectable and `Collection` can report duplicate stable keys without mutating data state.
- `Component` / `ComponentRuntime` carry normalized `ComponentProfile` metadata; adapters forward only explicitly authored profiles.
- no first-wave Picker business behavior was changed in Phase A.


### PHASE-A-002 — Shared Protocol authority integration
Status: DONE
Evidence:
- PR #48 merged
- merge commit `01875c583fe99c47ee249a4e9eeb6e86304f23f2`
- PR CI #315 / `35953604691`: success
- main CI + Pages #316 / `35953925660`: success on attempt 2
- attempt 1 failed only `tabs-indicator-measured` with an empty inline width while the identical code passed PR #315; retry of the identical main commit passed. Treat this as a recorded browser timing flake, not a framework semantic failure.
Outcome:
- `Collection` now uses `DataRevision` as stale-transaction revision authority.
- `ValueDraft` delegates controlled/external ownership and pending-request metadata to `ControllableStateCore`.
- `StateController.createValueBinding` exposes delegated ownership state without adding a second value truth.
- `verify:shared-protocol` covers Collection stale refs/reentrancy plus controlled proposal/external sync/uncontrolled transition behavior.
- ProjectionScheduler adoption was explicitly deferred because current DOM/Roving projection paths are synchronous and no competing async revision owner exists to replace.

### PHASE-A-001 — Baseline inventory + Shared Protocol foundation
Status: DONE
Evidence:
- PR #47 merged
- merge commit `51b7f317037fc538beaadc6f710da077a8429d0f`
- PR CI #312 / `35952642035`: success
- main CI + Pages #313 / `35952965100`: success
Outcome:
- existing authorities were mapped before adding Controller abstractions;
- added `ActionContext`, `OperationResult`, `ControllableStateCore`, `DataRevision`, `EnvironmentPort`, `ProjectionScheduler`, `Diagnostics`, `ComponentProfile`, `LogicalOwnerTree`, `InputModality` alias and Shared Protocol exports;
- no direct component migration was performed.

### OPS-001 — AI persistent state + repository documentation cleanup
Status: DONE
Evidence:
- PR #46 merged
- merge commit `a459e28f2486ce89615322c6e49094fddd8464a4`
- PR CI #307: success
- main CI + Pages #308: success
Outcome:
- added `AGENTS.md`, `AI_WORK_STATE.md`, and the complete master handbook;
- removed obsolete historical migration/stage/audit files;
- retained required HOTFIX6 compatibility artifacts only as `tools/fixtures/legacy-hotfix6/**`;
- removed numbered Stage navigation from canonical docs.

### CTRL-LEGACY-001 — Cascader controlled value
Status: DONE
Evidence:
- PR #36 merged
- merge commit `1ce69ad304088f0910993229426ba1a843b3d1fd`
- shared StateController option-value binding; controlled proposal/external sync and uncontrolled defaultValue coverage

Status: DONE
Evidence:
- PR #41 merged
- merge commit `20327c0d717a3a56a45e098d756e40eb9ae8c743`
Note:
- controlled ownership is done;
- rapid autosize animation reversal remains an active Motion issue.

### CTRL-LEGACY-004 — Dropdown controlled value
Status: DONE
Evidence:
- PR #43 merged
- merge commit `e2300ff0eb59fca8621218930fe6343f41c56309`

### CTRL-LEGACY-005 — Upload controlled file-list membership/order
Status: DONE
Evidence:
- PR #45 merged
- merge commit `a7702a2a66a2f201d1152c23c5d20ff1b1e9607e`
- UploadLifecycle remains runtime status/progress authority.

### FOCUS-LEGACY-001 — prior DatePicker/TimePanel focus cleanup
Status: VERIFIED_EXISTING, NOT SUFFICIENT FOR CURRENT QA
Evidence:
- PR #27 merged
- merge commit `6558fc5d1d008725a43a40fa869a0f9ba69cd367`
Rule:
- do not repeat the old investigation from zero;
- current QA reports remaining TimePanel focus defects, so reopen only the specific remaining FocusController/region ownership issue.

## DO NOT REDO

Unless a current regression or architecture migration invalidates the evidence:

- Do not redo the original 17-component controlled/defaultValue survey from zero.
- Do not recreate the completed ESM/src-to-dist migration as a new migration project.
- Do not restore `src/modules`, runtime Registry dependency lookup or old monolithic source architecture.
- Do not recreate Shared Protocol primitives already landed in PHASE-A-001.
- Do not re-run PHASE-A-002 authority ownership analysis from zero; only inspect impact when PHASE-A-003 touches those authorities.
- Do not reintroduce numbered Stage documentation as a second canonical docs tree.
- Do not re-open completed controlled semantics merely because a new Controller is being introduced; migrate the existing contract and test it.
- Do not treat deleted historical audit/log files as active requirements. Git history is the archive.
- Do not convert the recorded #316 attempt-1 Tabs timing flake into a framework change unless it reproduces with evidence.

## PAUSED

None.

## BLOCKED

None.

## Frozen decisions

- One owner / one truth; projection is not a second writable truth.
- The 11 Controllers reuse/evolve existing mature authorities rather than duplicating them.
- Shared Protocol Layer is infrastructure, not a 12th business Controller.
- Controller code must not branch on component names.
- Interaction routing is scoped/logical-owner based, not one global keydown handler.
- Enter and Space are context/profile dependent; they are not globally equivalent.
- Multiple checkbox primary toggle uses Space within its composite keymap; navigation/activation semantics remain profile-scoped.
- Picker close is not an implicit commit. Escape/cancel rolls back uncommitted draft.
- Complex composite regions use one canonical real-focus host plus virtual focus unless a native/hybrid-edit profile explicitly leases real focus.
- Current Git source/tests/manifests are preserved while migrating; do not roll back later fixes to match an old document snapshot.

## Checkpoint maintenance rule

Keep this file compact and non-contradictory:
- `CURRENT` contains exactly one active/ready Task ID plus one exact next step.
- Current authority facts belong only in `Current authority snapshot`.
- When a gap is resolved, replace its old current-state wording; do not leave both “does not exist” and “added” statements in active sections.
- `DONE` retains Task ID + outcome + PR/commit/test/CI evidence, not the full historical investigation.
- Historical findings that are no longer current truth move to DONE evidence or Git/PR history.
- Never append a second CURRENT task at the bottom of the file.
